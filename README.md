# XANICLE
A ~~AI~~ bot that we should hopefully ~~train~~ hard code to play crystal pvp\
\
Xanicle worst bot ngl
## Info
Xaniclebot is HT1\
Too bad xanicle is LT5\
Use to set the amount of totems the bot has access to:\
```/scoreboard players set xaniclebot bot_totems <value>```\
Use to set the difficulty of the bot:\
```/function xanicle:presets/<preset>```\
Presets:
 - Fish (canonically accurate Properdiamond)
 - Xanicle (Plays similar to actual xanicle, roughly HT3 skill)
 - Mwasher (Banned for CWing)
 - Normal (Generic / "normal" playstyle, roughly LT2/HT2 skill)
 - Evantii (Plays similar to evantii, roughtly HT1 skill)
 - godxanicle / HT0 (Max setting)
## Requirements
 - Fabric API
 - Carpet Mod
## To-do
 - [x] Hitcrystal idk
 - [ ] pathfinding
 - [x] anchor spam
 - [x] toteming
 - [x] pearling
